    What is Courage...?
       <br>
       Anika: Courage is doing something that makes you have to step out of your comfort zone, and try new things.
       <br>
       Tvisha: I think courage is stepping out of your comfort zone and doing something new.
       <br>
       Yosha: Courage is putting yourself out there and being subjected to new experiences.
        <br>
        <br>
       In our 7th grade advanced language arts class, we were challenged with creating a courage project. What is that you may ask?
       Well, we define it as a creative task to step out of your comfot zone. Our idea was to give back to the community by donating money to the
       food bank Sound Generations, and this caused us to step out of our comfort zone because we have to ask people in person for money. This will take courage because...
       <br> 
       a. We haven't ever done that before
       <br>
       b. We will have to propose a convincing reason why they should donate money
       <br>
       Therefore, we are meeting the requirements of the project while also doing something good for our community.
       Now that you have a bit of context about the project, please continue on with the website to see more about it!
