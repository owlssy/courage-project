    <h3>Often, people are uneducated about the statistics of their state. Here is some information about Washington's homeless and hunger population.</h3>

    <h2>HUNGER...</h2>
    <p class='specialPara'>One million Washington residents visited a food bank in the past year.
       <br>
       <br>
        1 in 10 Washingtonians consistently struggle with hunger.
        <br>
        <br>
        1 in 6 Washington kids live in a household that faces challenges in putting enough food on the table.
        <br>
        <br>
        1 in 8 Washingtonians live below the poverty line.
        <br>
        <br>
        1 in 8 Washingtonians relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to purchase food. Half of all people on SNAP are kids.
        <br>
        <br>
        The majority of working-age Washingtonians living in poverty are working or actively looking for work. Many work more than one job.
        <br>
        <br>
        Washington State ranks 10th in the country in overall wealth—and ranks 34th in food insecurity.
